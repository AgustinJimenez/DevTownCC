Using the StarWars API (https://swapi.dev) create a simple web app containing a `<select>` input to allow a user to select a Starship `manufacturer`.

In a `<table>` display a list of all Starships with the selected `manufacturer`. If no `manufacturer` is selected, display all starships in the table.

We primarily use React to build web applications but you can use any front-end JavaScript framework youâ€™d like (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc).

Notes:

The final result will not be evaluated on visual style, so you do not need to spend time styling (browser defaults are just fine) unless you want to.

A javascript library exists for the StarWars API. We request that you do not use the javascript library to interact with the StarWars API

NPM packages other than the StarWars API can be used but are not required to complete this assignment.
